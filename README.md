# Form a Story Project

## Objective

#### *Remember playing the word game Mad Libs as a kid? Here's your chance to play it again!*  :pen:

This game was created as part of a lesson about HTML forms, action and method attributes, label and input elements, and setting the type attributes for the fields.

This form specifically includes the text, number, dropdown, radio type, datalist, textarea, and submit attributes.

The required attribute, and setting minimum and maximum values/lengths for number and text fields are also used on this form.
